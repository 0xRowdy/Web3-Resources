Into
This space is intended to be a community where we can talk about and learn about developing on blockchain technologies. Feel free to add to this wiki as you lean this disruptive technology.

Getting started
There are so many resources out there to help learn blockchain development both in and out of Deloitte. Listed below are some that I found useful when getting started.

Udemy - Udemy has courses from blockchain fundamentals to Developing smart contracts on a variety of different blockchain technologies.

Crypto Zombies - A fun gamification way to learn Solidity. The language that powers Ethereum, Avalanche and a number of other blockchain networks. Good if you are already have experience as a Developer.

YouTube - What can't you learn on YouTube now? 100s of videos about blockchain and developing on the platform. Dapp University has a bunch of projects based on real world applications.

LearnWeb3 - A DAO focused on educating people on Web3. Starts at the core and works up to more advanced topics.

DevPill -  Devpill.me is a public good blockchain development guide aimed at becoming the go-to learning resource aggregator for building on Ethereum and its wider ecosystem of scaling solutions and applications.

Speed Run Ethereum - Learn to build on Ethereum; the superpowers and the gotchas. This provides a nice intro video intro to Ethereum Development and then leverages the very user friendly, all be it opinionated, Scaffold-ETH.

Empowering Women

Unstoppable Women of Web3 - An education group training the next generation of diverse talent, with a goal to onboard women to Web3

Women in Web3 - Women in Web3 is a global founder community and DAO of diverse women innovating and venturing together in web3.

Tools

Below you'll find a list of tools that will support or supplement blockchain development

Ganache - Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

Hardhat - The new kid on the block. Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks that are inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps, as well as easily introducing more functionality around this workflow.

OpenZeppelin - OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.

Mocha Testing Framework - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

Chai Assertion Library - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

Foundry - Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust and consists of:
Forge: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
Cast: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
Anvil: local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.

Alchemy - Alchemy Web3 is a drop-in replacement for web3.js, built and configured to work seamlessly with Alchemy and provide multiple advantages such as automatic retries and robust WebSocket support.

Infura - Our suite of high availability APIs and Developer Tools provide quick, reliable access to the Ethereum and IPFS networks so you can focus on building and scaling next generation software.

Moralis - Moralis provides managed backend for blockchain projects. Automatically syncing the balances of your users into the database, allowing you to set up on-chain alerts, watch smart contract events, build indexes, and so much more.

The Graph - The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

IPFS - IPFS (Interplanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open.

Starter Frameworks

Create ETH App - Similar to Create React App but provides boiler plate code for ETH app

Scaffold-ETH - Scaffold-eth provides an off-the-shelf stack for rapid prototyping on Ethereum, giving developers access to state-of-the-art tools to quickly learn and ship an Ethereum-based dApp.

Ethereum Boilerplates - 
Truffle Boxes - The OG on the scene. Truffle Boxes are helpful boilerplates that allow you to focus on what makes your dapp unique. In addition to Truffle, Truffle Boxes can contain other helpful modules, Solidity contracts & libraries, front-end views and more; all the way up to complete example dapps.
